# Toy (HTTP) Server
## By: Derek Tan / DrkWithT (GitHub)

### Summary:
This Java repo contains files and a codebase for a toy http/1.1 server. The server is unintended for production usage and nor has full compliance with HTTP/1.1. Although this will be at best a mediocre implementation, I will continue this project for learning about the HTTP protocol and network programming.

### Project Roadmap:
 1. Create basic worker and HTTP parser classes.
 2. Complete main, driver class.
 3. Handle GET requests with `text/plain`.
 4. Handle GET requests with `text/html`.
 5. Get the server to serve static pages.
